👋 Hi @JoshuaKGoldberg, thanks for the issue! A scan flagged a concern with it. Could you please take a look?

[[**text-image-alt-text**](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/OctoGuide/blob/main/docs/rules/text-image-alt-text.md)] The following image is missing alt text:

> ```md
> ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c44dd9-061a-41cf-a408-6774a872c737)
> ```

Alternative text, or "alt text", is a description attached to an image. It allows non-sighted users and tools to understand the image despite not being able to visually see it. To resolve this report, add descriptive alt text to the image.
